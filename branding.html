             We love it when people use or extend RIOT for either
             commercial or non-profit purposes. RIOT is open-source under
             LGPLv2.1 license.

             We emphasize, however, that we retain all rights to the RIOT
             name and logo, and related terms and catch phrases;
             collectively referred to as the "RIOT marks" in the following.
             This includes using the marks for promoting websites,
             services, businesses, and products
            </p>

          <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
            <p class="lead">
              While generally we are fine giving people permission to use
              the marks under many circumstances, we reserve the right to
              decide on a case-by-case basis. 
              Our main objective here
              concerns avoiding confusion: We want to ensure that when
              people talk about the community or operating system "RIOT",
              they all mean the same.

                    Distributing a modified version of RIOT and calling it
                    "RIOT" or "RIOT OS" requires explicit, written permission from 
                    <a href="mailto:riot@riot-os.org">us</a>.
                    This restriction is necessary to ensure that RIOT users
                    understand what the RIOT project has signed off on,
                    without risking ambiguity that would undermine the
                    trust into the system.
                    In short, if it is called "RIOT", it must be our RIOT.
                    We will usually allow these uses as long as the
                    modifications are (1) relatively small and (2) very
                    clearly communicated to end-users.
