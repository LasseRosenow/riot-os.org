question: How is RIOT development organized?
---

In short there are certain [Coding Conventions](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/CODING_CONVENTIONS.md) to follow and we are using [Github](https://github.com/)'s pull requests for code review. So for new features and fixes create a fork of the [RIOT repository](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT) and open a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

For a more in depth description check out the dedicated document on [development procedures](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Also, do check out the open [community processes](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/RIOT-Community-Processes).
