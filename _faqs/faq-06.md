**For critical vulnerabilities we would appreciate you to report them with a 90
day heads-up to [security@riot-os.org](mailto:security@riot-os.org) first,
before making them publicly available.**

It's a very good idea to search our
[forum](https://forum.riot-os.org){:target="_blank"} first, maybe someone has
already solved your issue! You can also create an account there, and post via
the forum website, or via email to [help@riot-os.org](mailto:help@riot-os.org)
following
[this guide](https://forum.riot-os.org/t/riot-forum-as-a-mailing-list/46){:target="_blank"}.
Another option is to log an
[issue](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/new/choose){:target="_blank"} in
GitHub.

You're also welcome to ask in the IRC channel #riot-os at
[freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net){:target="_blank"}, but don't be
disappointed if everyone there is busy.
